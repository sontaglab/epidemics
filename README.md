# Universal Features of Epidemic Models

This repository is dedicated to the numerical simulations of [the bioRxiv article](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.163931v1.full.pdf+html): 

doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.21.163931.

## Setup

All analysis here are done using [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org) version 1.4. Make sure to install [Differential Equations](https://docs.sciml.ai/stable/) package, along with the [Plots](http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/).

## Basics

You can find the information about different inputs used for periodic and single-pulse inputs in the `Inputs.ipynb` notebook.

# Results

## Main

The V shaped pattern and examples of optimal social distancing starting time and duration for different models has been given in the `Main.ipynb` notebook.

## Periodic

Simulation results of periodic social distancing relaxation policies, and their combination with single-pulse mandate has been given in the notebook `Periodic.ipynb`.

## Different Rates

Reproduction of the results with different contact rates of social distancing has been illustrated in the notebook `DiffBeta.ipynb`.

## Senstivity Analysis

This part is under review.
